  By default, this role does nothing as all `*_state` variables are set to `ignored`.
  For the components you're interested in, set the `*_state` variables to `present` or `absent`.

  The following components are available:
    * Jenkins — CI Service, `relkit_jenkins_*`
    * Aptly — Debian Repository, `relkit_aptly_*`
    * …

  **NOTICE!** Integration issues (firewalling, proxying…) are not managed here, use a support role.
