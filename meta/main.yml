  This role manages the provisioning of build and release tools and services:
    * [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org),
    * [Aptly](http://www.aptly.info),
    * (to be completed)
  
  By default, this role does nothing as all `*_state` variables are set to `ignored`.
  For the components you're interested in, set the `*_state` variables to `present` or `absent`.
  **NOTICE!** Integration issues (firewalling, proxyingâ€¦) are not managed here, use a support role.
